# data_cleaning_portfolio
In this repository you will find the files for my data cleaning portfolio example using SQL.

The idea for this example and the original data set (glassdoor_jobs.csv) was taken from an already existing data cleaning sample project, which you can find here:
https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Please be aware that this is NOT a copy of the project refered to on the link, this example contains different steps and is made on a different plattform.
