# data_cleaning_portfolio
In this repository you will find the files for my data cleaning portfolio example using SQL.

The idea for this example and the original data set (glassdoor_jobs.csv) was taken from an already existing data cleaning sample project, which you can find here:
https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Please be aware that this is NOT a copy of the project refered to on the link, this example contains different steps and is made on a different plattform.

The data set contains information of real data science related job vacancies posted in glassdoor website in the United States. 

In the file 'Cleaning data glassdoor jobs step by step.csv' you can find all the steps and comments to complete the data cleaning process. 
The file 'Cleaning data glassdoor final queries to run.csv' shows you only the part of the query that you should run to generate the final, cleaned data set without going through every step.
